Note: Commented imports in this project indicates the evolution from basic to modular.
So, I have not deleted the commented imports and the relevant methods.

# Digital_Data_Manager

# Inventory solutions

# ORM Used
SQLAlchemy - It allows developers to work with databases using Python objects instead of writing raw SQL queries, 
making database interactions more Pythonic and intuitive. It makes use of the models for specific table.

# Blueprint
Blueprints allow you to break your application into smaller, manageable pieces. Each blueprint can handle a 
specific part of your application, making it easier to maintain and develop.

# Views
In Flask, a view function is the essential piece of code that responds to requests in your application. 
When a user accesses a URL, Flask uses patterns to match the URL to the appropriate view that should handle it. 
The view, in turn, returns data that Flask transforms into an outgoing response.

# Marshmallow Schemas
A schema is a class that defines what format the data comes in. It dictates what fields exist, their types and 
validation on them. You create a schema by sub-classing marshmallow.
